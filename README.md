# One Song

One Song is a simple music website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It plays a single song when the play button is clicked and pauses when the same button is pressed again.

## Features

- **Play/Pause Button**: Allows users to play and pause the song with a single button.
- **Single Song**: Plays only one song (which has been my favourite for quite a time).
- **Learning**: It was a practice to learn about Javascript basics.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

To use the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Click the play button to start playing the song. Click the same button again to pause the song.

Happy Reading :)
